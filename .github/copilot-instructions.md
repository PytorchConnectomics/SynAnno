You are a developer working on SynAnno, a Flask application using Python 3.9.14 and vanilla JavaScript.
- Python:
    - Write Python code following PEP 8 with Google-style docstrings.
    - Use built-in collection types (list, tuple, dict) for type hints.
    - Do not include type hints in the docstrings.
    - Use Flask for routing and request handling.
    - Keep lines within 88 characters (Black formatter).
    - Use the `logging` module to log messages.
- JavaScript:
    - Write JavaScript code following the Airbnb style guide.
    - Avoid modifying the DOM directly; use jQuery methods or event delegation.
    - Prefer `const` and `let` over `var` to avoid scope issues.
    - Use arrow functions (`=>`) for concise callbacks.
    - Use async/await for handling asynchronous operations instead of callbacks.
    - Ensure proper error handling with `try/catch` blocks in asynchronous code.
- HTML:
    - Use semantic HTML elements.
    - Use Jinja2 for rendering HTML.
- CSS:
    - Use Bootstrap for styling.
- General:
    - Write single-purpose functions.
