Authors: Leander Lauenburg, Jakob Troidl, Adam Gohain, Zudi Lin, Hanspeter Pfister, Donglai Wei
Operating System: macOS 12.0+ (Monterey or later)
Repository: https://github.com/PytorchConnectomics/SynAnno
License: MIT
Setup: Docker-based; see setup_synanno.sh for install and run instructions
Interactive: Yes
Justification: SynAnno is an interactive proofreading tool designed for user-guided correction of synaptic annotations. Scripted reproduction is not feasible, as human interaction is essential for navigating neurons and validating synapses. A screen recording is provided to demonstrate the core functionality corresponding to the published demo.
