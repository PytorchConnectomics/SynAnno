SynANNO is a tool for proofreading and revising annotations for synaptic cliffs. The tool lets you evaluate annotations by marking them as "Correct," "Incorrect," or "Unsure."  Subsequently, you will be able to specify the fault of the label as "False Positive," "Bad Fit," "Polarity Switch," or by assigning a custom tag. The provided information can be downloaded as a comprehensive JSON. Further, the tool enables you to manually correct the masks of the center slice of instance marked as "Incorrect" or "Unsure." Additionally, you will be able to add instances that were so far missed (false negatives) using the Neuroglancer. Again you will be able to draw the mask for the center slice of those newly added instances. 

We only require editing the center slice mask as our model will use it as seed segmentation and compute the volumetric segmentation automatically.

In case you already possess the appropriate information in JSON format, you can directly start the mask editing by clicking on "Revise Data" and providing the source and target volume as well as the JSON
